  title: Learnable Representations for Estimating Visual Correspondence
  abstract: Finding visual correspondence is one of the fundamental image understanding problems. It is a challenging task due to strong appearance differences between the corresponding scene elements caused by, for example, changes in camera viewpoint and illumination, intra-class variation, or scenes changes over time.  In this talk, I will discuss our recently developed learnable representations for visual correspondence tasks with applications to category-level object alignment, observer localization in large-scale indoor environments with textureless areas and repetitive patterns, and place recognition across day/night illumination or changes of weather and seasons.

  title: Trends in Large-Scale Similarity Search
  abstract: In this talk, I will present some recent trends in the area of similarity search. I will first review the techniques that are routinely employed to index and search billions of image descriptors, such as local features or more global representations extracted from CNN architectures. Then I will present recent advances based on graph-descent algorithms, as well as emerging methods for indexing with neural networks.
